This one and Dogs Day Out are my favorite Al Pacino film (post Godfather) which you will recognize him as one of the best gems Hollywood can offer. He's really my favorite actor of all time no doubt about it. And Serpico proves he's the one. For a true story this is a very well made film with a very good writing. I felt bad for the guy being surrounded by narco politics

Serpico is the story of honest cop Frank Serpico who testified to bring down corruption in the New York Police Department and was almost killed for it. Starring Al Pacino back when he gave a shit, this is great cop movie full of early 1970s NYC grit. It is also a great companion piece to the HBO series The Duece as it deals with the "Knapp Commission" on police corruption mentioned in The Deuce  I only have two criticism of the film. A scene with Serpico and his girlfriend in a bathtub. Adapted from Peter Maas's book, Sidney Lumet's drama portrays the real-life struggle of an honest city cop against a corrupt system. Starring Al Pacino as the titular character, and filmed on location in every borough of New York (except Staten Island), "Serpico" effectively captures. Serpico (1973) - Obsada.

Viewed: August 14, 2016 Started: January 15, 2016 I've watched a few Sidney Lumet movies recently and have enjoyed them immensely. He is an excellent director, who understands how to get the most from his actors and crew. "Serpico" was no exception, though it might be my least favorite Lumet film I have seen to date. Given that the others include the likes of "Dog Day Afternoon" and "12 Angry Men", even my least favorite still ranks among the top movies I have ever watched! "Serpico" is based.
